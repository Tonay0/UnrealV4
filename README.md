# UnrealV4
This is the 4th version of my .bat and .vbs based computer virus "Unreal".
Although is written in batch and vbscript, it still damages your computer...
So, its better to execute the virus in a virtual machine for example "VirtualBox".


You will see a Setup folder in the main branch... This folder contains a perfectly ready Installer for "UnrealV4"


I am NOT liable for ANY Damage to your computer, when downloading / installing / executing the files.
